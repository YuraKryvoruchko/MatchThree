# Main game mechanics:

## Combinations:

Identical cells are stacked in certain combinations. Some of them form special cells.

1. Triple or quadruple horizontal or vertical line - explodes these cells;
2. Horizontal or vertical line of 5 elements - explodes these cells and create the supper cell;
3. A square of four elements - explodes these cells and create the lightning bolt cell;
4. Right angle from two triple lines - explodes these cells and create the bomb cell.

## Abilities:

Abilities are mechanics that perform a certain action on the playing field. It can be used either by interacting with special cells or by selecting in the gameplay menu.

**Simple abilities:**

1. Supper cell + default cell -> destroys all cells on the field of the default cell type;
2. Bomb cell + default cell -> 9 elements around the bomb are destroyed, including the bomb itself;
3. Lightning bolt cell + default cell -> destroys 3 cells on the field of the default cell type;

**Advanced abilities:**

1. Supper cell + Supper cell -> сompletely clears the playing field;
2. Supper cell + Bomb cell -> creates 5 bombs on the map and detonates them;
3. Supper cell + Lightning bolt cell -> creates 10 lightning bolts for random cells;
4. Bomb cell + Bomb cell -> 25 elements around the bomb are destroyed, including the bomb itself;
5. Bomb cell + Lightning bolt cell -> lightning strikes 3 random cells and creates an explosion in their place;
6. Lightning bolt cell + Lightning bolt cell -> creates 10 lightning bolts for random cells;

## Game modes:

The game has two game modes:
1. Level mode - its essence is that you have to destroy a certain number of elements of a certain type. The game has a limited number of moves (the move shields and invalidates the swipe of cells);
2. Long mode - you have an unlimited number of moves, there are no tasks, the essence of the mode is just to play and score as many points as possible to break your record.
